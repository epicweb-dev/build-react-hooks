# Preserve State

👨‍💼 Alright, so there are actually two problems here. First, when the user clicks
on the button, we update the `state` variable inside the `useState` closure, but
that variable is not accessible by our component. Our component has its own
variable called `count` which is not being updated

<callout-info>
	Just because two variables point to the same object in memory (or in our case,
	the same number) doesn't mean they stay in sync when one is reassigned. That's
	just how JavaScript works.
</callout-info>

The second problem we have is when our component is called, it calls `useState`
and that creates a brand new `state` variable that's assigned to the
`initialState` variable again.

So we need a way to preserve the state between renders. We can do that by
pulling the `state` and `setState` variables outside the `useState` hook and
simply assigning them on the initial render of the component.

Give that a try!

	The button will finally work on this one, I promise!
