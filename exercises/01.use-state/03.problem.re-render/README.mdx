# Re-render

üë®‚Äçüíº Ok, so we're initializing our state properly and we're updating the state
properly as well. The problem is we're not updating the UI when the state gets
updated. Remember, we're not React. We need to tell React when the state has
changed so it will render our component again.

Because we're not React, the way we will do this is by simply calling `render`
our root again. Remember what the bottom of our file looks like?

```tsx lines=4
const rootEl = document.createElement('div')
document.body.append(rootEl)
const appRoot = createRoot(rootEl)
appRoot.render(<Counter />)
```

That last line there is where we render the component. So we just need to call
that any time we want the component updated!

So in this exercise, wrap that bit in a function and call it once for the
initial render and once in the `setState` function.

Feel free to toss in a `console.log` in the component to make sure it's
re-rendering.

	When you're finished with this, the UI will **still** not work like you
	expect. I promise we'll get to that very soon!
