Hooray! You're all done! 👏👏

Of course there's much more we can do for our implementations to make them more
like the actual built in version of these hooks, but I think we've gone far
enough for you to understand how hooks work behind the scenes a bit.

If you want to explore the actual implementation of hooks in the source code,
[start here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/e02baf6c92833a0d45a77fb2e741676f393c24f7/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L3837-L3964).
It's pretty interesting (and certainly more complicated), but it's not entirely
dissimilar to what we've implemented. Hopefully this helps you understand how
React hooks work under the hood!
