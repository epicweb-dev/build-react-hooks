# Render Phase

🧝‍♂️ Hi! I made a change to the code a bit. Now we're rendering two buttons, the
count button is still there, but now we're also a button for disabling the count
button. I needed to add another `useState` for that, but it's not working. You
can <PrevDiffLink>check my work</PrevDiffLink> if you'd like. Can you get it
working? Thanks!

👨‍💼 Thanks for adding those buttons Kellie!

Ok, so what we need you to do is fix the problem. If you add a
`console.log({ count, enabled })` to the component, you'll get
`{ count: 0, enabled: 0 }`. This is because the first time the `useState` is
called initializes the state and the second time it's called, it just references
the first one.

So to start off fixing this issue, you're going to need to formalize how we
determine whether state gets initialized or referenced.

Really, `useState` can be called in two scenarios:

- Initialization
- Updates

So we're going to keep track of how this is called with a `phase` variable. The
emoji will guide you in the right direction. Good luck!
