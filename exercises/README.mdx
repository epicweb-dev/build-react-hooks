# Build React Hooks 🪝

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/tutorials/build-react-hooks/build-react-hooks-introduction" />

👨‍💼 Hello, my name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get
oriented and to give you your assignments for the workshop!

We're going to build our own implementation of React hooks so you get a deeper
understanding of how they work behind the scenes. We'll be building `useState`
and `useEffect`.

<callout-warning>
	This will of course not be as rigerous as the official implementation.
</callout-warning>

You're gonna rock with this! Let's get going!

🦺 One note, we're going to be doing some fun hackery around here so we'll be
abusing TypeScript a bit. Feel free to throw around `any` and
`// @ts-expect-error` here and there.

🎵 Check out the workshop theme song! 🎶
