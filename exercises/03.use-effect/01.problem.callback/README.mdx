# Callback

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/tutorials/build-react-hooks/use-effect/replace-react-s-useeffect-with-your-own" />

🧝‍♂️ I've added a `useEffect`, but it's not supported yet so the app's busted:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
	console.log('consider yourself effective!')
})
```

it? Thanks!

👨‍💼 Sure thing Kellie, thanks!

Ok, so what we need to do here is going to feel a little familiar. We'll want to
create an `effects` array that stores all the callbacks. Then our `useEffect`
hook implementation will actually be pretty darn simple: get the `ID` for our
hook, add the callback to the `effects` array. We don't even have to return
anything.

The tricky bit will be to make the `appRoot.render` call synchronous with
`flushSync` so we can iterate through all the effects to call the callback.

I think you can do it. Let's go!
