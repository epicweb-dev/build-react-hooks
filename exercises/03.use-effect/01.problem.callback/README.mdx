# Callback

🧝‍♂️ I've added a `useEffect`, but it's not supported yet so the app's busted:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
	console.log('consider yourself effective!')
})
```

You can <PrevDiffLink>check my work</PrevDiffLink> if you'd like. Can you fix
it? Thanks!

👨‍💼 Sure thing Kellie, thanks!

Ok, so what we need to do here is going to feel a little familiar. We'll want to
create an `effects` array that stores all the callbacks. Then our `useEffect`
hook implementation will actually be pretty darn simple: get the `ID` for our
hook, add the callback to the `effects` array. We don't even have to return
anything.

The tricky bit will be to make the `appRoot.render` call synchronous with
`flushSync` so we can iterate through all the effects to call the callback.

I think you can do it. Let's go!
